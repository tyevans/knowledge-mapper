# Reduced resource limits for staging environment
#
# Staging workloads typically have less traffic than production.
# Resources are approximately 50% of production values.
#
# Guidelines:
# - Requests: Minimum guaranteed resources
# - Limits: Maximum allowed resources
# - Staging values are suitable for low-traffic testing
