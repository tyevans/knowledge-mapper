# Reduced replicas for staging environment
#
# Cost optimization: staging doesn't require high availability.
# Single replica is sufficient for testing and validation.
#
# Trade-offs:
# - Lower cost (fewer pod resources)
# - No redundancy (acceptable for non-production)
# - Rolling updates will cause brief downtime (acceptable for staging)
