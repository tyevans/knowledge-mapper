# Production replicas for high availability
#
# High availability configuration:
# - Backend: 3 replicas (allows 1 failure + 1 updating)
# - Frontend: 2 replicas (static assets, lower requirements)
#
# Zero-downtime rolling update strategy:
# - maxSurge: 1 (one extra pod during update)
# - maxUnavailable: 0 (always at full capacity)
#
# Combined with readiness probes, this ensures:
# - No traffic to unready pods during deployment
# - Automatic recovery from single pod failures
# - Expected uptime: 99.9%
