"""
Entity merger implementations for cross-chunk entity resolution.

This module provides concrete implementations of the EntityMerger protocol:
- SimpleMerger: Basic deduplication by exact/fuzzy name matching
- LLMMerger: LLM-assisted resolution for ambiguous cases

Mergers are registered via decorators and created via EntityMergerFactory.
