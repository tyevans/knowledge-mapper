class SlidingWindowChunker:
    """Chunker that uses sliding windows with configurable overlap.

    Features:
    - Configurable chunk size and overlap
    - Sentence boundary awareness (tries not to split mid-sentence)
    - Paragraph boundary preference
    - Handles edge cases (short documents, empty text)

    The chunker uses a priority system for finding break points:
    1. Paragraph breaks (double newlines)
    2. Sentence endings (., !, ?)
    3. Word boundaries (spaces)
    4. Hard cutoff (if no boundaries found)

    Attributes:
        default_chunk_size: Default maximum characters per chunk
        default_overlap: Default overlap between chunks
        respect_sentence_boundaries: Whether to avoid mid-sentence splits
        respect_paragraph_boundaries: Whether to prefer paragraph breaks
        min_chunk_size: Minimum chunk size (avoids tiny final chunks)

    Example:
        chunker = SlidingWindowChunker(default_chunk_size=3000, default_overlap=200)
        result = chunker.chunk(long_text)
        for chunk in result.chunks:
