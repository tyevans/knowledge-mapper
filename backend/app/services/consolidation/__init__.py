"""
Entity consolidation service module.

This module provides services for identifying and merging duplicate
entities in the knowledge graph. The consolidation pipeline has
multiple stages:

Stage 1 - Blocking (this module):
    Generates candidate pairs efficiently using blocking keys
    to avoid O(n^2) pairwise comparisons.

Stage 2 - Fast Similarity (this module):
    Computes fast string-based and phonetic similarity metrics
    to filter candidates.

Stage 3 - Deep Similarity (P3-003, P3-004):
    Computes embedding and graph-based similarity for
    candidates that pass Stage 2.

Stage 4 - Decision (P3-005):
    Combines all scores and makes merge/review/reject decisions.

Stage 5 - Execution (this module):
    Executes merges, creates aliases, and emits events.

Example usage:
    from app.services.consolidation import (
        BlockingEngine,
        StringSimilarityService,
        MergeService,
    )

    # Find candidates using blocking
    engine = BlockingEngine(max_block_size=500)
    blocking_result = await engine.find_candidates(session, entity, tenant_id)

    # Compute string similarity and filter
    matcher = StringSimilarityService()
    candidates_with_scores = matcher.filter_candidates(
        entity,
        blocking_result.candidates,
        threshold=0.70,
    )

    # Candidates passing threshold proceed to Stage 3
    for candidate, scores in candidates_with_scores:
        # Compute embedding similarity, graph similarity, etc.
        pass

    # Execute merge for high-confidence candidates
    merge_service = MergeService(session, event_bus)
    result = await merge_service.merge_entities(
        canonical_entity=entity,
        merged_entities=[candidate],
        tenant_id=tenant_id,
        merge_reason="auto_high_confidence",
        similarity_scores=scores.to_dict(),
    )
