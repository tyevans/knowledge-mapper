"""
Graph query utilities for knowledge graph exploration.

This module provides a GraphQueryService class that wraps Neo4jService
and offers specialized query methods for path finding, neighborhood
exploration, similarity detection, and graph statistics.

All queries enforce tenant isolation to ensure data security in a
multi-tenant environment.

Example:
    from app.services.neo4j_queries import GraphQueryService
    from app.services.neo4j import get_neo4j_service

    service = await get_neo4j_service()
    query_service = GraphQueryService(service)

    # Find shortest path between two entities
    path = await query_service.find_path(
        source_id=source_uuid,
        target_id=target_uuid,
        tenant_id=tenant_uuid,
        max_hops=5,
    )

    # Get entity neighborhood
    neighborhood = await query_service.get_neighborhood(
        entity_id=entity_uuid,
        tenant_id=tenant_uuid,
        depth=2,
    )
